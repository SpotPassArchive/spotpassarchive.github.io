				<p>
					On <span class="yellow">April 8th, 2024</span>, Nintendo shut down online services for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS family of systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="blue">SpotPass</span> was a service used on these systems to distribute data for certain games via the internet. We've undergone a huge effort to archive all known SpotPass data through user-submitted dumps, and it was a massive success. We have since decided to accept more user-submitted dumps, as the SpotPass servers in particular somehow still seem to be online at this time.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the near future, we plan on publishing an archive of all of the SpotPass data we've been able to grab. More information will be available regarding that when we have more information to share.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to your help, various <span class="purple">network revival services</span> will continue to distribute SpotPass content for many titles, ensuring that features in these titles can be used long after Nintendo has pulled the plug.
				</p>
				<p>	
					In addition to the current dumping initiative, we have more plans for ways to archive old SpotPass data for a few specific games such as the StreetPass Mii Plaza. We hope to have more information to share on that soon.

				<p>Popular 3DS titles using SpotPass features include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="blue">StreetPass Mii Plaza</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special Miis (often of Nintendo employees) and puzzle pieces for the Puzzle Swap minigame. Without SpotPass, Puzzle Swap would normally not receive new puzzles.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Mario Kart 7</span>: SpotPass was used to receive ghost data from other players and Nintendo.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Pokémon games</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special Pokémon during events.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">New Super Mario Bros. 2</span>: SpotPass was used to receive a certain system message allowing the installation of DLC.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Tomodachi Life</span>: SpotPass was used to distribute special outfits and send messages to other islands.</li>
					<li><span class="blue">Swapnote</span> and <span class="blue">Swapdoodle</span>: SpotPass was used for sending and receiving notes (including notes from Nintendo).</li>

					<span class="bold">Q.</span> What's going to happen next for the archival project?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> We plan on moving to archive data for some specific games in the near future. We'll have more news to share about these efforts soon.

				<p>
					<span class="bold">Q.</span> Which games have SpotPass data archived?
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="bold">A.</span> Check the spreadsheets (<a class="blue" href="spreadsheets/3ds.html">this one</a> for 3DS, <a class="blue" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qU0o7zxILAZcI83nOidr1QSrM0maVp6OGdBqg0xwul0/htmlview">this one</a> for Wii U) to see which games have data archived. Do note that in the Wii U spreadsheet, if a game is marked as "complete", that does NOT mean that all data for that game has been collected. Rather, it means that <span class="italic">some</span> data for the game has been collected and it may or may not actually be complete.
