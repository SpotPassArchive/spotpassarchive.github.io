					<li>Any modded 2DS/3DS running Luma3DS CFW</li>
					<ul>
						<li>To check whether or not you have a CFW, while your system is off, hold down SELECT and then press the POWER button. If some text immediately appears on the top screen, then you have a CFW. Otherwise, that means you don't have a CFW and you need to <a class="blue bold" href="/index.html">go back</a> and select a non-CFW option.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>An SD card</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Download the latest release of <span class="bold">SpotPassDumper11</span> from the Universal Updater app on your system. Choose the <code>.cia</code> file if you wish to run it from your HOME Menu, or the <code>.3dsx</code> file if you wish to run it from your Homebrew Launcher.
						<ul>
							<li>You can also download it directly <a class="blue underline" href="https://github.com/SpotPassArchive/SpotPassDumper11/releases/latest">from GitHub</a> if you don't have Universal Updater.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Open <span class="bold">SpotPassDumper11</span> from either your HOME Menu or the Homebrew Launcher.</li>
					<li>Wait for the tool to do its thing. Information will be displayed on the bottom screen.</li>
					<li>
						If your system is connected to the internet, <span class="bold">SpotPassDumper11</span> will attempt to upload your SpotPass cache directly to us.
						If it is unable to upload your cache to the internet, the <code>partitionA.bin</code> file(s)
						will be located on your SD/microSD card in the <code>/spotpass_cache/</code> folder.
					</li>
					<li>If your system was unable to upload your dump, you can also submit it using the green link below.</li>
